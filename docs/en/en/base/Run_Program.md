#### Downloading a program

>Whats the difference between running and downloading a program? The play button puts our code into the volatile memory of your M5stack. Which means it will be lost once you turn off the M5stack. The download function however will store your program in the flash memory of your device which will not be erased on reboot. Each time you turn on the M5stack after downloading a program, that program will run automatically, and you can also select it from the app list which is accessed by pressing the center button on boot up.
