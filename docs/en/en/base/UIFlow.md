* __Coding area__
>Drag code blocks from the blocks list into the coding area and connect them together to create a program

* __Menu Bar__
>The menu bar contains most of the important functions of the interface such as（Example，Undo and redo，upload，run code，download code，save code etc...）

* __Blockly</>Python__
>All the code we create in blocks can be converted to python by pressing this switch

* __UI Designer__
>Drag the UI elements (Title, Lable etc..) down to the M5GO screen to design an avatar or UI interface (note: You must press the run code button to see the changes on the M5's screen)

* __Units__
>Units are sensors and actuators that can be plugged into the M5GO, and here is where we configure them
