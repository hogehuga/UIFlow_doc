## Input and output

All Units modules can be divided into two types, input and output.

#### Input type

>The input type Unit mainly transmits some environmental information in the form of data to M5GO in the form of collecting data.
>We can achieve control through the operation of these data

#### Output type

>The output type Unit is mainly in the form of a driver, with M5GO as the control core, driving some hardware connected externally, such as the rotation of the steering gear.


## Analog and digital

All Units modules can be divided into two types, input and output.

#### Analog quantity

>Analog quantity is a quantity that can be changed continuously, just like a thermometer will have many temperature values during the change process.

#### Digital quantity

>The digital quantity only has two states 0 and 1, just like a switch, only the on and off states
